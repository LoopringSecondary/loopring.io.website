            The objective of the "Withdrawal Mining" program is to incentivize
            our community to withdraw cryptoassets from centralized platforms
            and learn to take control of their assets with a non-custodial
            wallet.

                This program only supports Loopring Wallets that are on the new
                Loopring 3.6 protocol (If you create a wallet before Nov 27th, you can one-click migrate. All wallets created after Nov 27th are on v3.6 by default.)

                While the spirit of this program is to incentivize users to take control away from CEXs, assets coming from anywhere, including other self-custodial wallets are eligible.
