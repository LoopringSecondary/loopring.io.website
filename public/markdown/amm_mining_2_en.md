### Rules

1) This round starts at 00:00 AM on January 7st, 2021 CST, and lasts for 14 days.

2) Liquidity mining will be enabled for: LRC⇄ETH，ETH⇄USDT，and WBTC⇄ETH pool. The reward for each pool is 400,000 LRC, for a total of 1.2 million LRC.

3) We take random snapshots of the relevant AMM pools several times a day, and calculate the amount of rewards each LP earns based on the average of all snapshot balances in the round.

4) Adding liquidity through Loopring Wallet and will earn an additional 5% bonus.

5) All mining rewards are issued in LRC. This round's mining rewards will be directly distributed to LP's layer-2 accounts within three days of the end of the round.

6) For pools with liquidity mining, providing liquidity is how you mine. You automatically start mining without any other user action.

7) Mining does not involve locking up your funds, but the LP tokens must stay in your Loopring layer-2 account. If you withdraw LP tokens to the Ethereum mainnet, you cannot get mining rewards, because it will not be recorded in the snapshots. You can transfer part or all of your LP tokens to other accounts on layer-2, but the mining rewards will also follow.


### Additional Mining Pools

The following pools are also enabled for liquidity mining by their corresponding token issuance teams.

- AC/USDT to reward 9,600 AC
- vETH/ETH to reward 100,000 LRC
- WOO/USDT to reward $4,600 in WOO and $1,000 in LRC
- MCB/ETH to reward 1,050 MCB and $1,000 in LRC

Note: LP tokens are equity tokens issued by AMM pools to LPs. For example, the LP token of the LRC⇄ETH AMM pool is called LP-LRC-ETH. The relative proportion of LP-LRC-ETH represents your actual ownership of the LRC⇄ETH AMM pool. If you transfer LP tokens to other accounts, it is equivalent to transferring the corresponding underlying assets in the pool to other accounts.
