### Rules

1) This round starts at 00:00 AM on January 25th, 2021 UTC, and lasts for 14 days.

2) We take random snapshots of the relevant AMM pools several times a day, and calculate the amount of rewards each LP earns based on the average of all snapshot balances in the round.

3) All mining rewards are issued in LRC. This round's mining rewards will be directly distributed to LP's layer-2 accounts within three days of the end of the round.

4) For pools with liquidity mining, providing liquidity is how you mine. You automatically start mining without any other user action.

5) Mining does not involve locking up your funds, but the LP tokens must stay in your Loopring layer-2 account. If you withdraw LP tokens to the Ethereum mainnet, you cannot get mining rewards, because it will not be recorded in the snapshots. You can transfer part or all of your LP tokens to other accounts on layer-2, but the mining rewards will also follow.

Note: LP tokens are equity tokens issued by AMM pools to LPs. For example, the LP token of the LRC⇄ETH AMM pool is called LP-LRC-ETH. The relative proportion of LP-LRC-ETH represents your actual ownership of the LRC⇄ETH AMM pool. If you transfer LP tokens to other accounts, it is equivalent to transferring the corresponding underlying assets in the pool to other accounts.
