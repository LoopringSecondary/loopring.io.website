Failure or delay by Loopring in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights.

## 3. SERVICES
We provide the Services of transmitting, store and exchanging Tokens via App.  We reserve the right to add or delete specific Tokens and their related transaction pairs and automatic market making capital pools within the scope of the Service at any time without notice. The fact that the Services include (or not) any specific Token should not be interpreted as any form of recognition by us.  We will not recommend or endorse any specific Token for any purposes.


## 4. ELIGIBILITY
To be eligible to use our Services, you must be at least eighteen (18) years old and be able to form legally binding contracts.  You can only use our Services if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. **In particular, we would like to draw your attention: Loopring prohibits U.S. residents or citizens from depositing, withdrawing, buying or selling Tokens in the Loopring App.** Please make sure that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you. By using our Services, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements that we outline in these Terms. We may still refuse to let certain people access or use our Services, however, and we reserve the right to change our eligibility criteria at any time.

## 5. PRIVACY POLICY


5.1. We have provided a privacy policy (“**Privacy Policy**”) regarding the collection, retention, use, management and protection of user information in the process of providing our Services.  The Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.  The terms of our Privacy Policy have been incorporated into this Agreement by reference and apply to your use of the App.  We recommend that you read and understand all the contents of the Privacy Policy before using the Loopring App.

5.2. In order to provide the App continuously, stably and safely, we need to collect technical information about the Devices and related software, hardware and peripherals so that we can improve our products and provide you with any Services. You agree that we may contact you via email, WeChat, phone, post or SMS from time to time to provide you with information about goods or services that may be of interest to you.

5.3. The Loopring App or any Service may contain links to other independent third-party websites. Third-party websites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies (if any), and do not provide any guarantees for them. You need to make your own independent judgments about interactions with any third-party websites, including the purchase and use of any products or services accessed through them.


## 6. ACCOUNT AND GUARDIANS

6.1. In order to obtain the Service, you must register and create an Account using the functions provided through the Loopring App. The security of your Account is your personal responsibility, and we are not responsible for any loss caused by your failure to protect the security and privacy of your password (or any other security key or login information).

6.2. The functions provided by the Loopring App allow you to appoint a guardian. The appointment of a guardian is your personal choice and responsibility. We are not responsible for the actions, negligence or absence of the guardian, and you agree to be responsible for any disputes between you and the guardian designated by you (or any third party with the right to exercise any power).

6.3. You can choose the “Loopring Official Guardian” as your guardian. In such case, if you lose your Device, we will provide you with a method to recover your Account. Using Loopring Official Guardian to restore your Account depends on your prompt response to one or more electronic messages (maybe sent by SMS and/or email) to verify your identity (“Recovery Message").  Failure to respond to the Recovery Message immediately or fail to respond to the Recovery Message at all may result in the link being invalid, and you may not be able to request other Recovery Messages for a period of time thereafter. The Recovery Message may invite you to submit a unique code or identifier to us to verify your identity. Repeated failure to provide a correct or valid identifier may result in your Account being locked or unavailable for a period of time. If you rely on Loopring Official Guardian to provide Wallet recovery Services, but lose your registered mobile phone or cannot use your registered email address, you will never be able to recover your Wallet.  Loopring does not rely on User information to determine your ownership of a mobile phone or mailbox.  In other words, if you cannot use the registered mobile phone or email address, the Loopring Official Guardian will refuse to serve you and you may never be able to restore your Wallet.

## 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY & WARRANT DISCLAIMER


8.1. The Loopring App allows you to send and receive Tokens (each such event is called a “Transaction”). The choice of Transactions is entirely up to you. Any transaction, transfer or contract between you and any other user or third party shall be a private arrangement between you and the entity, and Loopring shall not be liable for such arrangements. You acknowledge that we do not provide or promise to verify the identity of any counterparty you may interact with. You are solely responsible for identifying and verifying the counterparty of the transaction you choose to conduct, and we are not responsible for any decision you make to send the Token to any third party. If you send the Token to an unexpected recipient, we will not take any responsibility for you. We cannot cancel or reverse your Transactions using the Loopring App, and are not responsible for any Transactions you enter incorrectly.

8.2. When you try to make a Transaction, there may be a delay between the initiation of the Transaction and the final execution. Such delays may be caused by delays inherent in the function of the underlying token network on which Transactions will be executed. No matter how such delays occur, we are not responsible for any such delays.

8.3. If you expect to receive the goods, assets or services for which the Token is valued for trading, then we will not be liable to you. In particular, if your expected consideration is not fulfilled or the quality is not satisfactory, we will not bear any responsibility to you, and will not make or provide any form of refund or compensatory compensation to you.

8.4. The token market is volatile and changes rapidly in terms of liquidity, market depth and transaction dynamics. You agree to bear the sole responsibility for the following: **any and all trading and non-trading activities on the Loopring App and your Account in the Loopring App, even if the Loopring App incorrectly presents any position or contract status of any other party on the Loopring App. You acknowledge and agree to take full responsibility and assume responsibility for: your trading and non-trading activities and omissions on the Loopring App and all gains and losses you suffer from using the Loopring App and any Service; any information for protecting the access to the Loopring App and any Service, including but not limited to private keys, usernames, passwords and bank account information.**

8.5. Token transactions depend on the normal operation of software protocols that we do not own.  Related agreements include open-source programs that are publicly available, and we cannot assume any responsibility for the failure of these agreements to operate as expected.  In particular, we are not responsible for any changes to such agreements or any “forks” of these agreements that result in the simultaneous existence of multiple instances of these agreements. You confirm and agree that you have the responsibility to inform yourself about the operation of the relevant software agreement on the basis of any token you choose to use in the Transaction, and you are responsible for making yourself aware of the “forks” of any agreement and taking appropriate measures.

8.6. **LOOPRING APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE APP AND THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS, AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE IN TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT ACCESSIBLE VIA THE SERVICES IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AVAILABLE, CURRENT, FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THE RESULTS OF USING THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.**


## 9. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

9.1. The entry, interpretation, amendment, supplementation and dispute resolution of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.  If there are no relevant provisions in the Applicable Law, then business practices and/or industry practices shall be referred to.

9.2. If any provision or part of this Agreement is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision or part will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or elimination of the provision will not affect any other provisions of the Agreement. 

9.3. Any disputes arising from this Agreement, or related to this Agreement, including any issues concerning its existence, validity or termination, shall be settled through friendly negotiation.  If either party is unwilling to resolve through negotiation, or cannot resolve within thirty (30) days, either party has the right to submit the dispute to the arbitration at International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) and follow ICC’s effective Arbitration Rules to appoint one or more arbitrators to arbitrate in accordance with the aforementioned rules.  The language of arbitration shall be English, and unless agreed upon by both parties, the place of arbitration shall be the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.  The arbitral tribunal's decision is final and binding on both parties to the Agreement.


## 10. FORCE MAJEURE
We will not be responsible for any failure to perform or delay in performance due to any behavior or event beyond our reasonable control (“**Uncontrollable Events**”) including major natural disasters, fires, other catastrophe, wars, terrorist activities, strikes, Device failures, telecommunication failures, etc.).  **In particular, I would like to draw your attention: you accept that the following events belong to Uncontrollable Events described in this clause:**

 - **(a) the security vulnerabilities in the code and data written and uploaded to the basic Token network that are used and integrated in the Loopring Application;**
 - **(b) the upgrade and fork of the Token contract, and**
 - **(c) the rollback and fork of the basic Token network.**


## 11. OTHER

11.1. You agree that we may assign any of our rights and/or transfer, sub-contract, or delegate any of our obligations under these Terms.  Your agreement to these Terms is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to any third party.

11.2. Our failure or delay to enforce your obligations in this Agreement or to exercise our rights against you does not mean that we have waived our rights to you, and it will not mean you do not have to comply with these obligations. If we do waive your default, we will only do so in writing, but this does not mean that we will automatically waive any of your future default.

11.3. The language of this Agreement is Chinese.  Any translated version is provided for the convenience of the Users only with no intention to modify the terms of this Agreement.  If there is a conflict between the Chinese version of this Agreement and the non-Chinese version, the Chinese version shall prevail.
